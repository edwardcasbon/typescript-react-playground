# Typescript and React playground
This is a small skeleton project to allow me to learn and play around with Typescript and React.

* Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
* Compile ES5 JavaScript by running `npm run build`.
* Serve the app in the browser at http://localhost:3000 by running `npm run server`.
